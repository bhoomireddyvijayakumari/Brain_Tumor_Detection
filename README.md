# Brain_Tumor_Detection

In this project, a deep learning-based image classification model was developed to automate the diagnosis of brain tumors from MRI scans. The solution targeted the classification of MRI images into four categories: glioma tumor, meningioma tumor, pituitary tumor, and no tumor. Leveraging the power of transfer learning, the MobileNetV2 architecture was employed due to its lightweight and efficient design, pre-trained on ImageNet to enhance feature extraction and accelerate convergence.

The dataset was preprocessed by resizing all images to a uniform dimension, normalizing pixel values, and applying data augmentation techniques such as rotation, zoom, and flipping to improve the modelâ€™s generalization. The model was trained using categorical cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer, and training progress was monitored using early stopping and model checkpoint callbacks.

Evaluation of the trained model was conducted using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. The model achieved an overall accuracy of 80% on the test set. Class-wise performance revealed high effectiveness in identifying glioma and no tumor categories, with F1-scores of 0.88 and 0.84 respectively. Pituitary tumors were detected with perfect recall (1.00), although with lower precision (0.68), indicating some false positives. Meningioma detection showed room for improvement, with a lower recall of 0.51, suggesting that the model missed several actual meningioma cases.

The confusion matrix further supported these observations, helping to visualize misclassifications between tumor types. Despite minor imbalances, the model demonstrates strong potential for aiding radiologists in rapid and reliable brain tumor diagnosis. A prediction function was also implemented to allow real-time classification of user-uploaded MRI images, which can be deployed through a Streamlit interface for clinical usage. Overall, the project showcases a practical AI-driven approach to enhance diagnostic workflows in medical imaging.
